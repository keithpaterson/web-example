# Just a test website with a simple service

* This could serve as a boilerplate for other new services
* Relies on 'resweave` which is not Open-source
* I stole some infrastructure from agilitree/monolithic-roots for this
  that I think could be merged into resweaved or added to a rw-extensions project?
