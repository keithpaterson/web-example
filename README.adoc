= Just a test website with a simple service

* This could serve as a boilerplate for other new services
* Relies on https://github.com/mortedecai/resweave[resweave]
* Also requires https://github.com/keithpaterson/resweave-utils[resweave-utils]

== How to access it from k8s

* First, know that this uses docker-k8s, not actual k8s
* Build the container and then run the deployment
** `./build/build.sh service -d`
** `./deploy/deploy.sh`
* Access it via `http://localhost:32754`

=== Notes about Ngnix (which is also required)

* install this after starting docker-k8s
* follow instructions here:
  https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/installing-nic/installation-with-manifests/
** don't bother with AWS or GCS/Azure instructions
* Find the port by querying the svc in the nginx namespace
** `kubectl get ns` will get you the namespace
** `kubectl describe svc nginx-ingress --namespace=nginx-ingress`
    And you can use other `kubectl` commands to find whatever else you need
* **NOTE**: This only works for http, setting up https would require additional auth related configuraiton
  which I'm not going to do for now.

=== Unit Testing
... is nonexistent at this point, consider it a TODO
